Hello, welcome to the repo for my site. Since it was created using Vite instead of Create-React-App things are a bit different to get it running:

`npm run dev`	Runs the app in development mode.

`npm run build`	Builds the app for production into the dist folder.

`npm run preview`	Serves the production build from the dist folder.

The site will be available on `localhost:7777` in development and on `localhost:4173` in preview.

Thanks for the vist!
